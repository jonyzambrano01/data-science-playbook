# Data Science Playbook

This project focuses on sharing the best practices to create Data Science and Analytics products. It suggests several best-in-class tools, but as tools and standards flexibility is a natural part of any Data Science project, we encourage people to take and adapt whatever piece of this project is useful for their Data Science projects. The following tools are suggested as part of the optimal Data Science workflow:

- `Python`
- `SQL - PostgreSQL`
- `VS Code`
- `Linux - WSL`
- `Spark - PySpark`

## Installation

- Installation instructions will be provided once the Jupyter notebooks and scripts have been created.

## Usage

- Please refer to the references folder to access the best practices and cheat sheets documentation.
